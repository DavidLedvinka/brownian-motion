# Lean formalization of a Brownian motion

Our goal is to formalize Brownian motions in Lean using Mathlib.
There are two main parts to this formalization:

* develop the theory of Gaussian distributions and build a projective family of Gaussian distributions and define its projective limit by the Kolmogorov extension theorem,

* prove the Kolmogorov-Chentsov continuity theorem.

For more information, see [the project home page](https://remydegenne.github.io/brownian-motion/), in particular the [blueprint](https://remydegenne.github.io/brownian-motion/blueprint/).

The project is ongoing.
