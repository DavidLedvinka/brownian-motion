\paragraph{Abstract}

Our goal is to formalize Brownian motions (or $\mathbb R^d$-valued Gaussian processes) in some generality using \texttt{Mathlib}.

\paragraph{Outline}

There are three main parts to this formalization:
\begin{itemize}
  \item develop the theory of Gaussian distributions,
  \item build a projective family of Gaussian distributions and define its projective limit by the Kolmogorov extension theorem,
  \item prove the Kolmogorov-Chentsov continuity theorem.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notation}

$T$ denotes an index set, \emph{a priori} arbitrary.

$\Omega$ is a measurable space.
