TODO: filtrations should be assumed right-continuous and complete whenever needed.

\begin{definition}\label{def:localMartingale}
Let $\mathcal{F} = (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+}$ be a filtration on a measurable space $\Omega$.
A local martingale with respect to $\mathcal{F}$ is a stochastic process $M : \mathbb{R}_+ \to \Omega \to E$ adapted to $\mathcal{F}$ such that there exists a localizing sequence $(\tau_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\tau_n$ is a stopping time for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
  \item $\tau_n$ is non-decreasing and $\tau_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ (a.s.),
  \item for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the stopped and centered process $M^{\tau_n} - M_0$ is a martingale with respect to $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
